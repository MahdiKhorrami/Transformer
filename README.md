# Transformer


### Description
This GitHub repository contains the code and data files associated with my seminar course project on analyzing specific event logs.
The project focuses on studying and extracting valuable insights from these logs using various data analysis techniques.
The code provided here implements the algorithms and methodologies discussed in the accompanying paper, "ProcessTransformer: Predictive Business Process Monitoring with Transformer Network" by A. Bukhsh et al.
The paper serves as a valuable reference for understanding the motivation, methodology, and results of this project.
